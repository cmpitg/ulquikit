# Ulquikit Internals #

This document describes how Ulquikit works and how it's used to bootstrap
itself.  For how to use Ulquikit in your project, see
[Ulquikit guide](guide.html).

## Concepts and definitions used in Ulquikit ##

| **Path**           | **Description**                                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `generated-docs/`  | *generated docs*                                                            |
| `generated-src/`   | *generated source*                                                          |
| `src/bootstrap/`   | Racket's bootstrap code                                                     |
| `src/config.yaml`  | Ulquikit configuration                                                      |
| `src/internals.md` | Literate source of this document, describing how Ulquikit works internally. |
| `src/guide.md`     | Literate source document, a guide on how to use Ulquikit                    |

* `src/bootstrap/css` and `src/bootstrap/js` are CSS and JavaScript files that
  will be included in the HTML format of *generated docs*.  Currently,
  Ulquikit uses [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) with Github
  style.  Contents of these 2 directories would be automatically copied to
  `generated-docs/` by `src/bootstrap/generate-resources.rkt`.

* Snippets (both *code snippets* and *file snippets*) are read, included, and
  extracted to their appropriate places by `src/bootstrap/generate-code.rkt`.

* Markdown files are rendered into HTML format by
  `src/bootstrap/generate-docs.rkt`.

* Other files speak for themselves.

### Snippet definition ###

* All snippet definitions are the first line of code block definition in
  Markdown.

* Snippet names are globally unique in the project.

* Snippet names can only contain alphanumeric , `_`, `/`, `.`, or `-` characters.

* A *code snippet* is defined by one line of format: `--> snippet-name <--`.

* A *file snippet* is defined by one line of format: `___ file-path-relative
  ___`.

* An instruction to include a code snippet to the current place: `-{
  snippet-name }-`.

## Notes ##

* All CSS and JavaScript files are minified with
  [Node Minify](https://github.com/srod/node-minify).

* Write down something to test

  ```racket
  --> some-snippet-just-to-test <--
  #lang racket

  (define (hello-world)
    (displayln "Â¡Hola mundo!"))

  -{ some-comment-here }-

  (define (main)
    (hello-world))

  (main)
  ```

* And other stuff

  ```racket
  ___ ./main.rkt ___
  (begin)
    -{ some-snippet-just-to-test }-
  (end)
  ```

* And just some comment

  ```racket
  --> some-comment-here <--
  ;; Really
  ;; It's just some random comments
  ```
