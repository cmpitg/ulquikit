The best way to learn about Ulquikit is to start from this document, section
<<getting-started,Getting started>>

[[getting-started]]
== Getting started

NOTE: Unless specifically noted, all commands are executed in your project
root directory.

[[project-structure]]
* Project structure:
+
Ulquikit makes use of a typical project structure:
+
----
project-name/
  generated-docs/  <1>
  generated-src/   <2>
  src/             <3>
    Main.adoc
  README.md
----
<1> generated documents
<2> generated source code
<3> your (literate) source code
+
Ulquikit could be used without making any change to your current project
structure.  By default, it detects literate source code with +.adoc+ or +.txt+
extension in +src/+ directory to produce corresponding documents and source
code.
+

* Generating source code:
+
Generated source code resides in +<project-root>/generated-src/+.
+
To generate source code:
+
[source,sh]
----
ulqui generate-src
----
+
You could also specify your own source and destination:
+
[source,sh]
----
# Uses literate source code from source/ and outputs to generated-source/
ulqui generate-src --from source --to generated-source
----

* Generating documents:
+
Generated documents reside in +<project-root>/generated-docs/+.
+
To generate documents:
+
[source,sh]
----
ulqui generate-docs
----
+
You could also specify your source and destination:
+
[source,sh]
----
# Uses literate source code from source/ and outputs to documents/
ulqui generate-docs --from source --to documents
----

== Notes

* Ulquikit will *not* handle the case of invalid AsciiDoc syntax.  Results of
  such situations are unexpected.

* Nested AsciiDoc blocks are *not supported*.  Supporting it brings more
  complexity to your literate source code, which does more harm than good.
  Please https://github.com/cmpitg/ulquikit/issues[submit an issue] if you
  think there's a better reason to support it.  I'm happy to hear your
  opinion.
