# Ulquikit Guide

### Variables definition

* Format:

  - Begun and ended with a single line containing 3 dashes (`---`).

  - For each var: `var_name: value`.

  - Variable names can **only** contain letters, numbers, dash (`-`), or
    underscore (`_`).  This restriction is to keep the names readable and
    clean.

  - Variable values are string, except for `authors`.

* User-defined variables (TODO)
